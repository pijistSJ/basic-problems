### **problem 1 `B`** :
write a function that takes one argument that is,
percentage increase of all side and returns the percentage change in area and circumferenece

for example :
in this , If each side of the square is increased by 25%.find the percentage change in it's area?,

input argument will be 25 or 0.25 depending on backend of your function

and function should return in string form whith formatted sentences like

```
" % change in area for 25% increase in all sides is 56.25%
and % change in circumf. for 25% increase in all sides is 25% "
```

Do same for other shapes too, like trapezoid,parallelogram,rectangle etc
